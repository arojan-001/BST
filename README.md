# BST
 Binary Search Tree (BST)
 Let's consider a simplified example of using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage a collection of contacts in a phonebook. 
 In this example, a Phonebook class uses a BST to manage contacts. 
 You can add contacts, search for contacts by name, and display contacts in alphabetical order based on their names. 
 This example demonstrates how a BST can be used for a simple organizational structure like a phonebook.
